This repository contains the relevant course work 

Untitled1 and untitled2 are mathlab files for Simulation of H-bridge DC/AC Inverter and Closed-Loop Controller Design and Simulation of H-bridge DC/AC Inverter 

Lab 4.1 file is for the initial PCB design following a guide

Lab 4.2 file was creating a PCB design from a data sheet and getting it printed

Untitlted5_1 is using the microcontroller with the Hands-on Power Electronics (HoPE) Console for PWM Embedded Coder for the Open-Loop Control with the written report

Untitled5_2 is the same as 5_1 but with Closed loop control with it's own written report

Report 6 shows Closed and Open loop control using the PCB we designed and soldered together
